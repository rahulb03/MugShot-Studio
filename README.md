## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.8+
- npm or yarn
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mugshot-studio.git
   cd mugshot-studio
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app/main.py
   ```
   The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in both frontend and backend directories with the required API keys and configuration values.

### Supabase Storage Configuration

The application uses three storage buckets:
- `profile_photos` - for user profile pictures (public read, owner write)
- `user_assets` - for general user assets (references, selfies, etc.) (private read/write for owners)
- `renders` - for generated thumbnail images (public read, backend write only)

These bucket names can be customized via environment variables:
- `PROFILE_PHOTOS_BUCKET`
- `USER_ASSETS_BUCKET` 
- `RENDERS_BUCKET`

To set up these buckets:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Storage → Buckets
3. Click "New Bucket" and create each bucket with the appropriate settings:
   - `profile_photos`: Public bucket
   - `user_assets`: Private bucket
   - `renders`: Public bucket
4. Apply the storage policies from `backend/migrations/002_storage_buckets_setup.sql` in the SQL Editor
